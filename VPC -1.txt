Virtual private Cloud - Network Engineering - IaaS
--------------------------------------------------

1. ESSENTIAL OF VPC:
Traditional system : Own Data Center - 
Activity Like EOD batch run - ATOS ORIGIN - Third party Data Center

CTS      TCS 
DC       DC
         

VPC - OWN DC / OWN NETWORK 
CLOUD-APPLICATION - 


=> Security, Response Time Quick, Business Continity Plan high level, Highly Available
   

2. GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE:

PUBLIC SUBNET
https://www.hdfcbank.com/ - APPLICATION URL
Personal
NRI
SME
Wholesale
Agri

Benefits:
Helps to understand the business running in the hdfcbank application
20000 - traffics per seconds - Public Subnet - slowness in webserver
10% - 2000 - Post Authentication - Private Subnet 

=>90% --Application performance always fast 


Validation:
Authentication:
Customer ID/ User ID
Password
Security Server + Security Db = "Your ID and IPIN do not match. Please try again"


Private Subnet:
Application Server 
Personal
NRI
SME
Wholesale
Agri       - online Transactions - Database server



3. 
2-tier -  Web or App + db
3-tier -  web + app + db


4. IP - Communicating two comp systems 
from 0 to 255 - Logic
987.34.56.78  - w
p24.t67.h78.n90 - w
173.45.67.89    - r


5. 
IPv4 - 32-bit, Numerical Numbers allowed, 215 crores private ips, 
IPv6 - 128-bit, Alphanumeric allowed, 860 crs pri ips - Work in progress 
       Android Application - Implemented 


6.
Public Ip  - Remote user Connection, Globally Unique, GLOBAL NETWORK INTERFACE TEAM, Dynamic Public IP
Dynamic - When we reboot, Auto-assign Public IP from GNIT to aws user 
Static  - constant, When we reboot it wont changes, Allocate from amazon pool TO AWS USER,  


10.23.45.67 - hdfcbank
10.23.45.67 - scb

ip conflicts 
No proper connection with apps


Private IP - Static, Host to Host Connection, Linking and Automation
             Application-Specific
CTS - 10.0.0.0
TSC - 172.45.34.67



7.
Monolythic    - Single layer,Single Framework, tightly coupled, TS-Impacts customers
                High level of Business and customer impact
Microservices - Multi layer,Multi Framework, Loosly coupled, TS-No or Low
                No or Low level  Business and customer impact

Application Load balancer - "Path based routing" - 95% industry adoption
Microservices architecture
Network Load Balancer:
8009
9009
7007
6004
3005



8.
Cloud Service provider : aws  - 215CRS IPS 
Company : CTS  - 65536 PRI IPS
Peter Non-techie  : HDFCBANK  - {PUBLIC SUBNET + AUTHENTICATION + PRIVATE SUBNET}
                                 256 pri ips  + Auth + 256 pri ips

Load balancer - Distributes traffics to the available resources
Autoscalling - Scale-up and Scale-down
route 53: domain register - simple routing policy


9. CIDR - Classless Interdomain Calculator
aws ips : 215 crs
CTS : 65536 IPS  - 10.0.0.0
HDFC : 256 + 256

10.0.0.0/32   -  1
10.0.0.0/33   -  "Invalid CIDR format"
10.0.0.0/31   -  2
10.0.0.0/29   -  8
10.0.0.0/28   -  8

10.0.0.0/24   -  256
10.0.0.0/16   -  65,536


10.0.0.0/1   -  2,147,483,648


public subnet : 10.0.1.0/24 -256
Private subnet : 10.0.2.0/24 -256

formula = diff = tot bit size of ipv4 - cidr value
               = 32 - 28 = 4
2 to the power of diff(4) = 2*2*2*2 = 16




10. Scope of the Project: RESTRICT REMOTE USER ACCESS THE PRIVATE SUBNET DIRECTLY
